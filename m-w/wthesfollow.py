# Follows up the cached lookups of Wordleable words in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate速
# Dictionary with a lookup using the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate速 Thesaurus API.
#
# Successful lookups are followed by a two minute sleep to keep the total lookups well
# under the noncommercial limit of 1000 requests per day.
#
# Results are written to files in pre-existing subdir ./cache-thes/
# where files are named <word>.json if the response returned what
# looks like a list of entries for the word, or <word>.not-found if
# what was returned looks like a list of strings (near-misses/matches).
#
# Some basic checks are made to avoid repeating and overwriting
# results that are already known.
